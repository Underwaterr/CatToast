# Simple Blog Framework
I tried making as simple a framework for a blog as I could! Featuring lots of semantic HTML5 & a comments section. The big anti-feature is that because everything is dynamically loaded, Google can't index anything but the homepage.

To add a blog post:
 - Add metadata to the js/articles.json
 - Create a markdown file in /markdown/
